Azure ML:
	- put into production models:

	- kubernetes for real time continuous application

	- interested in all skill levels not only for experts, user experience.

	- industry leading MLOps

	- open

	- trusted

	new interface next month

	-Models -> versioning of models for production

	- Endpoints for deployment: batch and real time.
		can deploy to any place, also your web site

experiment workflow:
	- name experiment 
	- load data (iris.csv)
	- can download model and use it on other application

ML Studio:
	drag and drop toolkit (uses scikit-learn as open tools under the hood)

	there is a run your own python/R model.

create new vm:
	choose the size
	can have a schedule time to run and pause machines.
	can install packages with pip install.


How do I take a model into production?

MLops:
	api are available open and on github


Focused on Data Science experience:
MLperf: standard for machine learning -> look up.


Principles of AI:

model training is the main focus on ethical ML
policies to deal with sensible data

Engineering Practice:

interpretml

wrap algorithms together, understand if a new algo is good or not.

Will be available fairness gridsearch -> fairlearn

	offer loans at the same rate men and women -> is there a bias in data.


Privacy and Security.
	protect info and resist attacks

	Trusted execution environments: POC Trusted 
		encription of models, results, data
		working also on training models
		it is encrypted in RAM
		need to trust hardware
	Homomorphic encryption:
		slower but not hardware trust need.

		Differential Privacy:
			injects noise to prevent to get back to individuals from aggregated data.
Microsoft + Harvard develop privacy platform with differential privacy.
